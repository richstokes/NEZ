# Project Overview
We are writing a NES emulator in python.


# Workflow
1. Run the emulator with: `rm log.log;reset; timeout 15s pipenv run python main.py mario.nes > log.log`
2. Ask me how well it worked
3. grep or head or tail the log for relevant information. Use this to help debug and fix the emulator.
