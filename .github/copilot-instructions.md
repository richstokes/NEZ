# Project Overview
We are writing a NES emulator in python.


# Workflow
1. Run the emulator with: `./run_and_log.sh` -- it will start the emulator and log output to `log.log`.
2. Ask me how well it worked / if I saw any issues or errors.
3. grep or head or tail the log.log file for relevant information. Use this to help debug and fix the emulator.
